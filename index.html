      <h2>Let Us Start With Why...</h2>
      <p>
        Before I ever even thought about coding, I was fascinated with
        technology and wondered how it worked. One of my earliest memories is
        peering into my Nintendo 64’s slot and questioning how all the
        characters in the game could possibly fit through such a tiny space.
        Nowadays, I comprehend this was an absurd childhood speculation. The
        curiosity and the drive to figure out how the components of something
        work are still with me though, and they, along with a few other
        personality traits of mine, helped drive me into the world of
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been a very technical person. By the age of twelve, I was
        ripping the carburetors out of my dirt bikes and trying to open the jets
        up. Somewhere I had read more gasoline equated to higher combustion
        which resulted in faster speeds. Since the carburetor’s jets controlled
        the flow of the precious gasoline, I purchased a Dynojet kit with my
        birthday money and proceeded to carry out my planned alterations.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a few days of hard work, the carborator was back in one piece on
        the bike. There was one major problem though; the bike sputtered and
        died out at idle. This was how I discovered more gasoline only results
        in more combustion if more air is also added into the equation. Without
        increased levels of air, the bike runs rich, and the too wet gasoline
        simply drowns out my spark plus. My bike sat for weeks until my friend’s
        father gave me some much bigger air filters.
      </p>

        width="500"
      />
      <p>
        Sadly, the days of my childhood mechanical adventures are over and done
        for. In 2019, virtually everything in a dirt bike is controlled by a
        computer. For example, carburetors have been replaced by the injector,
        and we also have Ram Air systems. Instead of rebuilding the carburetors,
        stripping down most of the bike and then putting it all back together
        again for the adjustment, all you have to do now is plug a bike into a
        computer and program how you want it to run.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of a computer program saving me all of the time and effort is
        truly amazing. Days of hard and dirty work are abstracted away by a few
        minutes of clicking. I am constantly coming across similar situations
        where programs transform a daunting and difficult task into a mundane
        and simple one.
      </p>
      <p>
        After four years of serving my country as a Combat Medic in the
        military, I found myself searching for a new career field. Since I have
        always had a passion for technology and wanted to become the person
        behind these programs, I decided to be a developer. I was a little
        confused about how I would achieve my goal though and questioned if I
        could spend another four year obtaining a degree in this field.
      </p>
      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p>
        My original plan was quite simple. The next three months would consist
        of me teaching myself how to code and ensuring programming was something
        I truly loved doing. If this phase of my plan was successful, I would
        then apply to college in the spring. My entire curriculum came from
        YouTube and CodeAcademy. Any extra time I had was devoted to reading and
        watching videos in order to get a feel for what area of programming
        interested me the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with easier material. HTML5 was my first language, and then I
        quickly learned how to style my mark up with CSS. I was amazed at how
        fast I learned to fully build landing pages. I soon added Python and
        JavaScript to my curriculum. At this point, I was following the general
        consensus of the developers I viewed on YouTube since I was focused on
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was coding in Python too because it was so
        much fun!

      />
      <p>
        Around month two of my independent study period, I decided I did not
        need to pursue a four year Computer Science degree at a university. I
        felt like I was learning so much on my own, and all of the feedback I
        was receiving agreed with this. Around month three, I secured a low
        paying internship for the corporate office of a nutritional supplement
        company I already worked for; I was extremely lucky to receive this
        internship. While I did not gain a lot of new coding skills at it, I did
        obtain related knowledge in workflow processes like completing tickets,
        participating in stand-up meetings, and utilizing Git/GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary responsibilities for this internship included updating the
        existing code base to be up to the accessibility standards of the new
        company policy. Also, I tweaked existing site styling and ran
        performance audits. Overall, I was very grateful for this internship
        opportunity but desired something which would allow for me to really
        learn new code. I felt I was not progressing as much as I had been when
        I was simply learning new things all day by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around month five of my internship, I was hearing about coding
        bootcamps. They claimed to give you all of the knowledge you needed for
        a real programming job in only three months. WOW!! At first, I doubted
        the credibility of these claims since they seemed so unbelievable. After
        quite a bit of research, I was still unsure. Many online sites and
        forums warned against these bootcamps and said they preyed on people who
        thought they could earn six figure salaries in just three months. This
        angle did not apply to me personally though; my focus was not on the
        money. I really desired to get better at something I enjoyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After weeks of mulling it over, I decided to join a coding bootcamp. I
        even planned on applying for a loan from the bank and quitting my
        current job so I could dedicate all of my time to the bootcamp. I had
        decided to attend Hack Reactor’s three month course since I wanted to
        attend class in-person and they had a location in my city. Even though
        many people were warning me against it, I decided to take the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two weeks before I was scheduled to start the bootcamp, I was still
        participating in my normal afternoon study routine. While watching my
        favorite channel, Funfun Function, I came across an advertisement for Lamda School.
        I was very intrigued by what they said. After a little bit more
        research, I confirmed it was everything I was wanting and needing from a
        coding bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lamda School was very different from the previous bootcamps I had looked
        at. Instead of twelve weeks, Lamda was a nine month plus accelerated
        Computer Science course. Even after the nine months of full-time course
        work, you could elect to take four more complete curriculum tracks for
        free! They were teaching a full stack program and were staying up to
        date and only teaching cutting edge technologies like React and Node.js.
        I really enjoyed the CEO Austen’s message and decided to apply that same
        day. This time around, I did not read any forums, I did not reach out to
        anyone, I simply did what I knew in my heart I had do.
      </p>
      <img
        class="img"
        src="img/lambda.png"
        alt="Logo for Lambda School"
        width="400"
      />
      <p>
        About a week after I applied, I had my interview with Lamda and was
        accepted! Luckily, a few phone calls to Hack Reactor and my bank
        resulted in me obtaining a full refund of my money. My time was now
        occupied with Lamda’s twenty hours of pre-course work, and my cohort
        would start in two weeks. I was excited to spend at least ten hours
        everyday for the next nine months learning through Lamda. I was fully
        ready to commit to this exciting opportunity.
      </p>
      <h2>The Middle</h2>
      <p>
        My experience at Lambda school fully lived up to my expectations. The
        first four months of curriculum were absolutely brutal. The first month
        consisted of topics I had believed I knew well like HTML and CSS. Lamda
        proved to me I still had much room for improvement; Lamda did not just
        stop at teaching me how to code. They also taught me the skill of
        learning how to break down a problem into its base components, the
        history, and the culture. They did not tell me how to think, and I
        believe this is the mistake other bootcamps make. These other bootcamps
        force feed you the syntax until you can simply copy it back into another
        program. Lamda teaches you how to think and program your own code. The
        teach you how to find the answers to solve your own problems even if you
        have not encountered them before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following three months consisted of learning React and Node.js. While the 
        class’s format was the same, I found this segment to be much more challenging 
        since I did not have prior experience in these technologies. I focused on the 
        core of what Lamda was trying to impart in its students though. I knew the main 
        objective was learning how to think, break down a problem, and the ability 
        to utilize the right resources effectively to quickly cipher through massive 
        amounts of documentation. React and Node.js are just another tool in my 
        toolbox to solve problems; the genuine skill is problem solving and analysis.  
      </p>

        src="img/1_-NOQtyJAGQ1RNC3iVt_thA.png"
        alt="Logo for react and node.js"
      />
      <p>
        Finally, the next five months consist of a major capstone project with a hiring 
        manager, and then the next eight weeks focus on Computer Science topics. This 
        material will cover matters such as hash tables, various algorithms, and 
        optimization in Python. I would not have obtained this information in any 
        other bootcamp or anywhere else short of a college education. Lamda is 
        truly a unique and superior experience. 
      </p>
      <h2>Now...</h2>
      <p>
        Upon completing the base curriculum, I applied and was selected for a four month
        contract position as a Lamda School Team Lead. My responsibilities will include 
        assisting the school with administrative duties and tutoring a team of 
        approximately ten students through the beginning of their Lamda experience. I am 
        thrilled to help others learn while increasing my own knowledge. I believe 
        teaching and explaining these concepts to others will solidify my new skills 
        while allowing me to gain more leadership experience. My time at Lamda was not 
        always smooth. I had setbacks and frustrating periods where I did not always 
        grasp the material quickly; however, I believe this will make me a more valuable 
        mentor since I understand the struggle.  At the conclusion of these four months, 
        I will start my capstone project. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I could not be more appreciative of all of the opportunities Lamda gave to me. 
        My experience at this school really honed the development of my social skills 
        and gave me an edge I could not have received anywhere else. The ability to 
        be connected to so many like-minded students who were experiencing the same 
        late nights and weekends of completing homework assignments and hobby projects 
        was unforgettable and invaluable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While I am still not at my dream, full-time developer job earning 80k, I believe 
        I am far enough along in my journey to becoming an employed programmer to create 
        this blog since I now know how to code. I can appreciate the fact I will always 
        have more concepts and technologies to learn in this field, and I am ecstatic 
        and up for this challenge!
